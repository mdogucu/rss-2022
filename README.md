TALMO Teaching Stats Event Talk

A First Bayesian Course: Why, What, and How

During this talk, I will discuss the importance of Bayesian statistics for undergraduate learners. I will share an outline of an undergraduate Bayesian course and examples from the open access “Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Bayesian Modeling with R” book. I will provide insights about computational aspects of teaching Bayesian statistics and include examples from the {rstan} and {rstanarm} as well as the {bayesrules} package - a pedagogical package that supplements the Bayes Rules! book.
